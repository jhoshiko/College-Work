For Sprint 4 there was a code restructure. Documentation was researched for file structure. This site was shared with the group via slack. Here is the site used the reorginization was based on.

Also during Sprint 4, there was a GITHUB project called "Java decompiler, assembler, and disassembler" used to provide a better code structure.
